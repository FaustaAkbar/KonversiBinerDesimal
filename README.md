# 🧮 Binary to Decimal Conversion

This repository contains a website that converts **binary numbers to decimal** using two methods: **Divide and Conquer** and **Brute Force**.

## ✨ Features

- 🔀 **Divide and Conquer**: This method breaks the conversion process into smaller sub-problems, then combines the results to get the final solution. This method is more efficient in terms of computational time, especially for large-scale inputs.
- ⚙️ **Brute Force**: A traditional method that iteratively converts binary numbers into decimal through direct calculations.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the [conversion website](https://faustaakbar.github.io/KonversiBinerDesimal/).
2. Enter the binary number you want to convert.
3. Select the method you wish to use (**Divide and Conquer** or **Brute Force**).
4. The conversion result will be displayed in decimal format.
